sphinxtr:  The Sphinx Thesis Resource
*************************************


Preamble
========


Abstract
========

This project is a collection of extensions and monkey patches to
Sphinx to better format a PhD thesis.


Acknowledgements
================

Thanks to Sphinx for a kickass build system and docutils for the
groundwork of multiple format output.


Dedication

Introduction
============

Creating a PhD thesis is typically done using LaTeX. This works really
well for producing a PDF, but a giant PDF file is not a great way to
put documents on the web. There are solutions that exist to turn latex
source files into HTML, but in my experience, they tend to produce
poor HTML output.

The Sphinx project is a wonderful tool for creating portable
documents, allowing for output to many different formats.
Unfortunately, it has many shortcomings when trying to typeset
something so advanced as a PhD thesis. The aim of this project is to
modify Sphinx to support all of the needs of a thesis writer. Many of
the patches are not appropriate for contributing directly to the
upstream Sphinx repository, so this is instead a separate project.

This sphinxtr output is available in several formats at:
http://jterrace.github.com/sphinxtr.

The source code for sphinxtr can be found at:

Installation
------------

Install the required Python packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


Building
--------

You need "make". The following targets are supported:

html
   Builds HTML format, separated into sections

singlehtml
   Builds HTML format on a single page

text
   Builds text files, separated into sections

singletext
   Builds a single text file

latexpdf
   Builds into latex source files and then compiles into a PDF.
   Requires latex.


Changes
-------

The following changes and additions have been made from vanilla
Sphinx:

* A cross-format bibtex bibliography based on sphinx-natbib

* Tables that can go inside figures

* Changed table formatting to look pretty, like booktabs

* Improved alignment in table environment

* Added support for short captions that show up in the "list of
  figures" section

* Changed equation reference formatting from "(1)" to "1"

* Full customization of latex preamble and style file

* Numbered figures

* Numbered section references

* A singletext output that builds into a single text file, similar to
  singlehtml

* A subfigure environment


Documents Using sphinxtr

Typography
==========

This chapter has typography stuff. This also shows how to have a
toctree inside a chapter.


Headings
--------

The title of this chapter, "Typography", is the first heading level.
This section, "Headings", is the second level.


Third-level
~~~~~~~~~~~

The third level heading. You probably shouldn't go beyond this because
it just looks ridiculous, but you can anyway.


Fourth-level
""""""""""""

The fourth level heading.


Fifth-level
+++++++++++

The fifth level heading.

-[ Rubric Heading ]-

A rubric heading is just a paragraph heading without document
structure.


Text
----

You can make *emphasized text*.

You can make **bold text**.

You can make "fixed-width font".

You can make block quotes:

   this is a block quote

You can make code blocks:

   this is a code block

Some convenience substitutions are defined in the epilog:

* e.g.,

* i.e.,

* et al.

* dashâ€”

* non-breaking space -> <-

You can have inline ^superscript or _subscript text.

Big quotes, also known as an epigraph:

   *Your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limitations
   of your equipment. If you're ugly, you can make your avatar
   beautiful. If you've just gotten out of bed, your avatar can be
   wearing beautiful clothes and professionally applied makeup. You
   can look like a gorilla or a dragon, or a giant talking penis in
   the Metaverse. Spend five minutes walking down the street, and you
   will see all of these.*

Lists
=====

This is a few examples of different list types.


Unordered Lists
---------------

* item 1

* item 2

  * item 3

  * item 4

* item 5


Ordered Lists
-------------

1. item 1

2. item 2

   1. item 3

   2. item 4

3. item 5


Description Lists
-----------------

term1
   definition 1

term2
   definition 2

term3
   definition 3


Mixed
-----

term
   definition

   * list1

   * list2

term2
   something

   1. num1

   2. num2

      * list1

      * list2

   3. num3


Math
====

Math uses latex math syntax:

   A^{''}_c = \sqrt[3]{ (\frac{L^2_c}{\sum{L^2}})
   (\frac{A_c}{\sum{A}}) (\frac{A'_c}{\sum{A'}}) } \cdot T

Equations can have labels which you can reference eq-cc-err-stop.

   \frac{log(1 + E_{current})}{log(1 + E_{max})}


References and Citations
========================

You can reference a section by its label. This chapter is Chapter 5.


Subsection
----------

This subsection is Section 5.1.


Citations
---------

COLLADA [1] is a cool 3D file format. I wrote a paper about 3D stuff
[3]. The website we built is running [2]. The bibliography is in
bibtex format.


Footnotes
---------

Reference a footnote [1].


External Links
--------------

You can link to a website.

-[ Footnotes ]-

[1] This is a footnote at the end of the page or document.


Figures and Tables
==================


Vector SVG Figures
------------------

Vector figures are nicely supported. You should have a PDF file and an
SVG file. The PDF will be used for the latex output and the SVG for
the HTML output. The HTML output has a nice zoom feature using
Colorbox.

   [image: Sirikata System Overview][image]The Sirikata metaverse
   platform architecture.

See an example in Figure . I suggest making figures in something like
Inkscape. If you have only a vector PDF, you can use pdf2svg to
convert ("brew install pdf2svg" or "apt-get install pdf2svg").


Image Figures
-------------

Regular rasterized images work fine too.

   [image: Open3DHub Browsing Interface][image]The Open3DHub website
   allows browsing of 3D meshes.

A PNG example is shown in Figure .


Subfigures
----------

The subfigure directives allow you to place multiple figures side-by-
side in the document. Here's an example:

You can reference the entire Figure  or one of its subfigures, e.g.,
Figure .


Table
-----

Tables can be put inside the figtable directive which automatically
numbers them, adds a caption, and adds a label.

+-------------+------+------+------+------+------+
| Progressive | 128  | 256  | 512  | 1024 | 2048 |
+=============+======+======+======+======+======+

Mean size of progressive format as a fraction of the original across
all test models, shown as a function of the progressive stream
downloaded and texture resolution.

Table  has all right-aligned columns.

+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Left Align              | Right Align               |
+=========================+===========================+
| Some text is left align | Followed by right-aligned |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Some more text here     | And more text here        |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| And even more text      | Also even more text here  |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+

This table has mixed alignment

Table  has one column left-aligned and one column right-aligned.


Text Wrapping Table
-------------------

Text wrapping in tables work if you specify the width and either
raggedleft or raggedright.
